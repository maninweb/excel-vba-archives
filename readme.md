# Introduction
Years ago - exactly in **2009** - I created several tutorials for VBA in German and wrote articles about them in one of my blogs. The blog where these tutorials were available does not exist anymore. However, some of the tutorials are still requested from time to time e.g. in forums.
Therefore, I uploaded some of them here. The Excel files are unprotected and you can for example use them in you own project, by keeping a reference to the original author.
# Notes
Some of the files may use references to other products, which may require a license. It is assumed, that you legally own a license for these products. Due to their age and may be use of Windows API functions, please always consider to not have important files open when testing the files.
# Support
No support, no warranty and no guaranty of any kind are given.

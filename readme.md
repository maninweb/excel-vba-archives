# Introduction
A long time ago - starting from **2009** for being more exact - I created several tutorials for VBA - mostly in German - and wrote articles about them in one of my blogs. The blog where these tutorials were available does not exist anymore. However, some of the tutorials are still requested e.g. in forums.
Therefore, I uploaded some of them here, after removing personal info and some non-public code from the files. The Excel files are unprotected and you can for example use them in your own projects, by keeping a reference to the author.
# Notes
Some of the files may use references to other products, which may require a license. It is assumed, that you legally own a license for these products. Due to their age and maybe use of Windows API functions, please always consider to not have important files open when testing the files. You are using these files at your own risk.
# Support
No support, no warranty and no guaranty of any kind are given.
